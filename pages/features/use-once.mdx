# Fetch only once

You can use `useOnce` to fetch a resource on mount and on key change, but only if there is no data.

```typescript
XSWR.useOnce(handle) 
```

### Warning

Will still try to fetch is there is an error.

### Motivation

You want to get some data once and share it in multiple components.

### Example

```typescript
function useMyData(init?: MyData) {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson)
  XSWR.useOnce(handle)
  return handle
}
```
