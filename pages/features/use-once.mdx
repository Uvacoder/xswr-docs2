# Fetch only once

You can use `useOnce` to fetch a resource on mount and on key change, but only if there is no data.

```tsx
XSWR.useOnce(handle) 
```

### Motivation

You want to get some data once and share it in multiple components.

### Warning

Will still try to fetch if there is an error.

### Example

```tsx
function useHelloOnce() {
  const handle = XSWR.use(getHelloSchema, [])

  XSWR.useOnce(handle)
  return handle
}
```

### Implementation

```tsx
export function useOnce(handle: Handle) {
  const { data, fetch } = handle

  useEffect(() => {
    if (data === undefined) fetch()
  }, [data, fetch])
}
```
