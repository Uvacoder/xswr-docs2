# Garbage collection

XSWR automatically delete unused data by doing reference counting and using expiration times.

For a resource to be garbage collected, you just have to return an expiration time in your fetcher.

Basically, a resource is garbage collected if there are no more references to it AND the expiration time has exceeded.

### Example

This will set an expiration delay of 60 seconds.

```typescript
async function fetchAsJson<T>(url: string) {
  const res = await fetch(url)
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(await res.text())

  return { data: await res.json(), expiration: Date.now() + (60 * 1000) }
}
```

You can also use response headers like `Cache-Control` to set the expiration time accordingly.
