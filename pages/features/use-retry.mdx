# Retry on error

You can use `useRetry` to retry on error using the exponential backoff algorithm.

```typescript
XSWR.useRetry(handle, { init: 1000, base: 2, max: 3 }) 
```

### About

[Exponential backoff algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) allows you to retry fetching a resource if an error is thrown, but on a increasing interval using a geometric progression.

So basically, it will wait `init * (base ** count)` milliseconds between each retry, where count is the number of retries, until count is equal to max.

### Example

With `{ init: 1000, base: 2, max: 3 }`:

1. First retry will wait `1000 * (2 ** 0) = 1000 ms`
2. Second retry will wait `1000 * (2 ** 1) = 2000 ms`
3. Third retry will wait `1000 * (2 ** 2) = 4000 ms`

You can see that the interval is multiplied by 2 (our base) for each retry.

With `max = 4`, the fourth retry would wait 8000 milliseconds.

### Warning

The count is reset when a retry succeeds.

### Usage example

```typescript
function useMyData() {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson)
  XSWR.useFetch(handle)
  XSWR.useRetry(handle, { init: 1000, base: 2, max: 3 }) 
  return handle
}
```
