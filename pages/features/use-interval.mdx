# Fetch on a regular interval

You can use `useInterval` to fetch a resource on mount, on key change, and on a regular interval.

```typescript
XSWR.useInterval(handle, 1000) 
```

### Motivation

You know that some data is regularly updated.

### Warning

Will also refetch on mount and on key change.

### Example

```typescript
function useMyData() {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson)
  XSWR.useInterval(handle, 1000)
  return handle
}
```
