# Deduplication cooldown

By default, XSWR uses a 1000ms deduplication cooldown. 

That means components won't refetch a resource if it was already fetched less than 1000ms ago.

You can pass a custom cooldown to both `useSingle` and `useScroll` to override or disable this behaviour (pass 0 to disable).

Basically, the fetch is prevented if `Date.now() - state.time < cooldown`, where state.time is the last time a resource was mutated.

### Example

```typescript
function useMyData() {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson,
    5000) // <--- your custom cooldown
  XSWR.useFetch(handle)
  return handle
}
```

### Tips

You can trick the deduplication process by passing a custom `state.time` in `mutate()`.

Passing a time of `0` will ignore the deduplication time as `Date.now() - 0 > cooldown`.

Passing a time in the future will increase the deduplication time.
