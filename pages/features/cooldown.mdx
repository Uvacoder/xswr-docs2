# Deduplication cooldown

By default, XSWR uses a 1000ms deduplication cooldown. 

That means components won't refetch a resource if it was already fetched less than 1000ms ago.

You can use a custom cooldown to override or disable this behaviour (use 0 to disable).

Basically, the fetch is prevented if `Date.now() < state.cooldown`.

### Resource cooldown delay

You can set a cooldown delay for all resources in your core provider.

```tsx
function MyWrapper() {
  return <XSWR.CoreProvider
    cooldown={5000}>
    <MyAwesomeApp />
  </XSWR.CoreProvider>
}
```

Or you can set a cooldown delay for some resource.

```tsx
function getHelloSchema() {
  return XSWR.single<Hello>("/api/hello", fetchAsJson, { cooldown: 5000 })
}
```

### Response cooldown time

You can also set a cooldown time directly in your fetcher.

```tsx
async function fetchAsJson<T>(url: string, more: XSWR.FetcherMore<T>) {
  const { signal } = more
  
  const res = await fetch(url, { signal })
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error()

  const data = await res.json() as T
  const cooldown = Date.now() + 5000
  return { data, cooldown }
}
```

For more control, `cooldown` is a time, not a delay (you must add `Date.now()` if you use a delay).

You can also use response headers like `Cache-Control` to set the cooldown time accordingly.
