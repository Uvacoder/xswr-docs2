# Deduplication cooldown

By default, XSWR uses a 1000ms deduplication cooldown. 

That means components won't refetch a resource if it was already fetched less than 1000ms ago.

You can pass a custom cooldown to both `useSingle` and `useScroll` to override or disable this behaviour (pass 0 to disable).

Basically, the fetch is prevented if `Date.now() - state.time < cooldown`, where state.time is the last time a resource was mutated.

### Resource cooldown delay

You can set an cooldown delay for all resources in your core provider.

```tsx
function MyWrapper() {
  return <XSWR.CoreProvider
    cooldown={5000}>
    <MyAwesomeApp />
  </XSWR.CoreProvider>
}
```

Or you can set an cooldown delay for some resource.

```tsx
function useMyData() {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson,
    { timeout: 5000 })

  XSWR.useFetch(handle)
  return handle
}
```

### Response cooldown time

You can also set a cooldown time directly in your fetcher.

```tsx
async function fetchAsJson<T>(url: string) {
  const res = await fetch(url)
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(await res.text())

  const data = await res.json() as T
  const cooldown = Date.now() + 5000
  return { data, cooldown }
}
```

For more control, `cooldown` is a time, not a delay (you must add `Date.now()` if you use a delay).

You can also use response headers like `Cache-Control` to set the cooldown time accordingly.

### Tips

You can trick the deduplication process by passing a custom `state.time` in `mutate()`.

Passing a time of `0` will ignore the deduplication time as `Date.now() - 0 > cooldown`.

Passing a time in the future will increase the deduplication time.
