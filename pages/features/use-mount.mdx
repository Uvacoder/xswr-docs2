# Fetch on mount

You can use `useMount` to fetch a resource on mount only.

```typescript
XSWR.useMount(handle) 
```

### Motivation

Use it when you DON'T want to refetch when the key changes.

### Warning

Won't fetch on key change, see [useFetch](/features/use-fetch) for doing so.

### Example

```typescript
function useMyData() {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson)
  XSWR.useMount(handle)
  return handle
}
```
