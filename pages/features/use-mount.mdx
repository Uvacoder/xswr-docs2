# Fetch on mount

You can use `useMount` to fetch a resource on mount only.

```tsx
XSWR.useMount(handle) 
```

### Motivation

Use it when you DON'T want to refetch when the key changes.

### Warning

Won't fetch on key change, see [useFetch](/features/use-fetch) for doing so.

### Example

```tsx
function useMyData() {
  const handle = XSWR.useSingle<MyData>(
    `/api/hello`, 
    fetchAsJson)
  XSWR.useMount(handle)
  return handle
}
```

### Implementation

```tsx
export function useMount(handle: Handle) {
  const { fetch } = handle

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch()
  }, [])
}
```
