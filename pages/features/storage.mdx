# Persistent storage

You can create a persistent storage and use it only where you want.

## Creating a storage

Create a storage either at top-level...

```tsx
const storage = new XSWR.IDBStorage("mydb")

function getHelloSchema(storage?: XSWR.Storage) {
  return XSWR.single<Hello>("/api/hello", fetchAsJson, { storage })
}

function useHelloMix() {
  const handle = XSWR.use(getHelloSchema, [storage])
  useAutoFetchMixture(handle)
  return handle
}
```

...or using a hook.

```tsx
function getHelloSchema(storage?: XSWR.Storage) {
  return XSWR.single("/api/hello", fetchAsJson, { storage })
}

function useHelloMix() {
  const storage = XSWR.useIDBStorage("mydb")
  const handle = XSWR.use(getHelloSchema, [storage])
  useAutoFetchMixture(handle)
  return handle
}
```

You can also pass it into a CoreProvider or ParamsProvider to enable persistent storage for all children.

```tsx
const storage = new XSWR.IDBStorage("mydb")

function MyWrapper() {
  return <XSWR.CoreProvider
    storage={storage}>
    <MyApp />
  </XSWR.CoreProvider>
}
```

## Types of storage

### IDBStorage

- Constructor: `new XSWR.IDBStorage(name)`
- Hook (static): `useIDBStorage(name)`

This storage is asynchronous and uses the browser IndexedDB.

IDBStorage is the best storage you can use:
- it's compatible with SSR
- it can store very large objects with complex graphs
- it doesn't need a serializer

Warning: Being asynchronous allows the use of SSR, but it won't display data on first render.

If you want to display data on first render, you can do so by using either:
- SyncLocalStorage
- useFallback()

### AsyncLocalStorage

- Constructor: `new XSWR.AsyncLocalStorage(serializer?)`
- Hook (static): `useAsyncLocalStorage(serializer?)`

This storage is asynchronous and uses the browser LocalStorage.

Being asynchronous allows the use of SSR, but it won't display data on first render.

If you want to display data on first render, you can do so by using either:
- SyncLocalStorage
- useFallback()

You can pass a custom serializer (default is JSON) for serializing values (keys are already serialized by the `Params` serializer).

### SyncLocalStorage

- Constructor: `new XSWR.SyncLocalStorage(serializer?)`
- Hook (static): `useSyncLocalStorage(serializer?)`

This storage is synchronous and uses the browser LocalStorage.

Being synchronous allows displaying data on first render, but it won't work with SSR.

You can pass a custom serializer (default is JSON) for serializing values (keys are already serialized by the `Params` serializer).
