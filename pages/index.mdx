# hazae41's xswr

The simplest React data (re)fetching library ever made

```bash
npm i @hazae41/xswr
```

## Philosophy

XSWR uses two new approaches compared to other data fetching libraries like swr or react-query:
1) Encapsulating key+fetcher+params in a single abstraction called schema.
2) Composing features with very simple hooks instead of having bloated configuration and unexpected behaviours.

## Features
